# franz-clone
A clone of the Franz app

Literally a clone of the [Franz app](https://meetfranz.com/) that was made in Electron. The purpose of this was just to test out if I can clone Franz, and make it usable, at least for my purposes.

This is not as fully-featured, nor as stable as Franz is, and I would suggest that you go get the original app instead if you want a more robust app. This was made for educational purposes only.

## Services
Only three(3) services were added because those are the only ones I needed to use(Slack, Messenger, and Discord). Feel free to fork this repo, and add your own.
